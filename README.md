# SmartPrice
Desktop application that provides smart pricing for the parts counter at Air Brake & Equipment.

There are various subjective variables in the truck parts industry that makes pricing difficult (demand, truck-down situations, shipping, delivery, etc). Pricing for part x varies depending on these variables. Moreover, particular customers have different pricing levels (municipal, private, etc). Accordingly, it can be difficult for parts countermen to correctly price parts. This applicaiton seeks to account for these different variables and provide accurate price quoting for parts.

This project is not complete. The backend is more or less completed, with a funcitoning database that can add/update/delete customer information. 
What is left/curerntly being worked on is building the GUI. Specifically, the pages where pricing calculations will be done. The page 
that can interact with the DB is mostly done.
