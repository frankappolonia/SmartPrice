# SmartPrice
Desktop application that provides smart pricing for the parts counter at Air Brake & Equipment.

There are various subjective variables in the truck parts industry that makes pricing difficult (demand, truck-down situations, shipping, delivery, etc). Pricing for part x varies depending on these variables. Moreover, particular customers have different pricing levels (municipal, private, etc). Accordingly, it can be difficult for parts countermen to correctly price parts. This applicaiton seeks to account for these different variables and provide accurate price quoting for parts.
