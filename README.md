# SmartPrice
Desktop application that provides smart pricing for the parts counter at Air Brake & Equipment.

This project is not complete. The backend is more or less completed, with a funcitoning database that can add/update/delete customer information. 
What is left/curerntly being worked on is building the GUI. Specifically, the pages where pricing calculations will be done. The page 
that can interact with the DB is mostly done. 

Estimated time of deploying version 1.0 is December 1st.
